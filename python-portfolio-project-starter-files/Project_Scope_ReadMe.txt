Project Scope Document for Predictive Insurance Cost Estimator
1. Project Title: Predictive Insurance Cost Estimator

2. Organization Name: Personal Data Science Portfolio Project

3. Problem Description

3.1. Business or Policy Problem: The increasing cost of health insurance is a significant concern for both individuals and policy makers. Efficiently predicting insurance costs based on personal attributes could aid in personal financial planning and policy making.
3.2. Who or What is Affected: Individuals seeking to purchase health insurance, health insurance companies, and policy makers.
3.3. Magnitude of Affected: Affects millions of health insurance buyers and sellers across the U.S.
3.4. Priority: This analysis can help in personal financial planning and in creating more accurate insurance models, making it a high priority for potential users and stakeholders.
3.5. Previous Efforts: Traditional insurance cost predictions often use broad categorizations, lacking personalized insights. Advanced data analysis methods have not been fully utilized.
3.6. Involved Stakeholders: Data scientists, policy makers, health insurance companies, and individuals looking for insurance.
4. Goals

Goal 1: Increase Personal Financial Planning Efficiency (Effectiveness)
Constraints: Data availability, accuracy of predictive models.
Goal 2: Enhance Health Insurance Pricing Models (Efficiency)
Constraints: Model complexity, regulatory compliance.
4.2 Trade-offs: Balancing model accuracy with complexity and usability for non-technical users.
5. Actions

Action 1: Develop a predictive model for insurance costs.
Goals: Supports all stated goals.
Executors: Data scientists.
Target: Insurance cost data.
Frequency: Model will be created once for demonstration purposes.
Channels: Digital platforms.
Constraints: Data privacy regulations.
Ethical Issues: Data privacy and consent.
6. Data

Internal Data Sources: Medical Cost Personal Data Sets.
Contents: Age, sex, BMI, children, smoker status, region, charges.
Granularity: Individual level.
Update Frequency: Not applicable for the provided dataset.
External Data Sources: None specified.
Ideal Additional Data: More granular data on medical history, updated regularly.
7. Analysis

Analysis 1: Descriptive statistics of the dataset (e.g., average age, majority region).
Analysis 2: Comparative analysis of costs (smokers vs. non-smokers).
Analysis 3: Predictive modeling (predict insurance costs based on inputs).
8. Ethical Considerations

Privacy, Confidentiality, and Security: Adherence to data protection laws is critical.
Transparency: Clear communication about data use and model methodology.
Discrimination/Equity: Ensuring the model does not inadvertently bias against any group.
Accountability: Responsibility for model accuracy and ethical use lies with the project owner.
